## 02 - Chuncking

## What is a chunck?

- Chuncks are pieces of information bound together through meaning or use
  - The mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning
- When you focuses your attention in something, your prefrontal cortex tries to connect the four slots of your working memory

### Chuncks are the internal connections of memory slots

- If you have chuncks for an action, it will be easier to access these neuron patterns
- When you are stressed, it's hard to make connections between memory slots, so it's harder to remember things and make decisions
- The path to expertise is built the memory little by little, so small chuncks becomes larger and enables more creative interpretations

### Chuncking helps yout brain run more efficiently

- Once you chunck an idea, you don't need to remember all the details about it. You can handle with the bigger picture.

## How to form a chunck?

- The best chuncks are so well ingrained that you don't even have to conciously think about connection the neural pattern together!

### Learning by examples

- It helps you to understand the steps you need, in what you should pay attention to learn something

- **Strategies to learn different disciplines should be different!**

### The Three Steps on Chuncking

1. **Focused Attention**
   - Simply focus your attention on the information you want to chunk
2. **Understanding**
   - Understand the basic idea you're trying to chunck
     - **Understand** is hold the underlying memory traces together
   - If you don't practice something you understand, your brain doesn't keeps the chunck strong in your mind
3. **Practice**
   - Gain context!
     - Not just **how** but also **when** to use a chunck
   - **Context** means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broady
   - Practice helps you broaden the network of neurons that are connected to your chunk
     - Not only firm but also accessible from different paths

### Tips to learn math and science

- While reading, close the book and test yourself if you can solve the problem you read

- **When you finally understand something, you can do it yourself!**

### Tips to Read Books and Papers

- Before read a text or a paper, check all the figures, equations and headings of sections to be familiarized with its big picture!

## Seeing the Big Picture

### The value of a Library of Chuncks

- Chuncks are transferable!
  - Old chuncks can help you understand new concepts, even in different fields
- If you have a library of concepts and solutions internalized as chuncked patterns, you can more easily find to the right solution
  - The diffused mode can help you to connect two or more chuncks together in new ways to solve novel problems

### Ways to figure something out or solve problems

- Sequentially:
  - Use the focused mode
- Holistic:
  - Use the diffused mode

# Learning How to Learn

Barbara Oakley - McMaster University

## 01 - What is Learning?

## Focused Mode Vs. Diffused Mode

### Focused Thinking

- When concentrate to understand something

### Diffused Thinking

- Build new neural connections along new pathways
- Enables new and different connections of ideas and mental mechanisms

Example of Diffuse Mode: When we solve a work problem while taking a bath

## Using Focused and Diffused Modes

- Diary practical (consistency) is more useful than try to learn everything in one take
- **Rest your mind and sleep is important**!
- Study in the night before the exam is the worst strategy
- **Learn new thins is hard!** (and also an exercise of humility)
  - You "hurt" your convictions and let your mind build new connections

## Procrastination, memory and sleep

- More abstract ideas needs more practice

### Practice can make permanent

- Better concentration and organization of neurons
  - Strong neural structures

#### A method to study something

1. Study it hard by focusing intently
2. Take a break (or at least change your mind focus to something different)
   - The time relaxing enables your brain's diffuse mode to work away in the background and build new connections to help the understanding
3. Come back to the focused study!

- Example: **The Pomodoro Technique**
  - 25 minutes in focused mode
  - 5 minutes in diffused mode

### Introduction to Memory

- Memory can be classified as:
  - Long-term memory
  - Working memory
  - Short-term memory

#### Working Memory

- Related to what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind
- Make connections using the long-term memory
- Contains about four "chunks" of information
- **Needs repetitions** to put something in your work memory
  - Repetitions are needed because of natural dissipation process stuck those memories away

#### Short-term Memory

- Works like an inefficient and limited mental blackboard

#### Long-term Memory

- During sleep, your brain cleans up some toxic substances obtained during the day
  - brain cells relaxes during sleep, and the fluids can wash the toxins out
- Very important to mental and body health
- Sleep is also important to the memory and learning process
  - It erases less important parts of memories and strengths more important and trained parts!

- Sleep is like a more deep state of relaxation and more severe state of diffuse mode

**First Law of Thermodynamics**

**Paths of PV Work (means constant Temperature)**

* Considering work against gravity (first figure case). The general expression to describe the work is:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-26 at 17.51.03.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-26 at 17.51.03.png)

*
* Solving for the case which external pressure is constant:

* Consider an **isothermal compression** at constant temperature:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-26 at 17.55.40.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-26 at 17.55.40.png)

*
* It’s important to note that work depends on the path taken from V1 to V2
* For a compression, the minimum work is done along the reversible path, which means walk over PV curve
* In infinitesimally small steps, Pext is made infinitesimally larger than Pgas. Thus, at every step Pext is equal to the equilibrium gas pressure Pgas

* Considering an **isothermal expansion**:
*
* For an expansion, the maximum work is done on the surroundings along the reversible path

**Differentials and State Functions**

* State Functions:
*
* A state function is a property that depends only upon the state of the system
* That is, it is independent of how the system was brought to that state (independent of the path)
* Example: Energy

*
*
* Work and Heat are _**not**_ state function. They’re path functions:

* **The First Law of Thermodynamics**: Energy is conserved

**Microscopic Origin of Pressure**

* Work and Heat:
*
* Starting from the expression to internal energy:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.54.31.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.54.31.png)

*
* Take the differentiate:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.55.14.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.55.14.png)

*
* Interpreting this comparison with dU:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.57.55.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 16.57.55.png)

*
*
* Differential work is small changes in energy levels with constant probabilities
* What pressure does in reducing a volume in a box, for example, that would split the energy apart, become more wider

*
* Defining **Pressure**:

**Enthalpy**

* Considering constant pressure conditions, for a reversible process where the work is restricted to PV work:
![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.23.14.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.23.14.png)

* At constant volume condition (V1=V2):

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.23.14.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.23.14.png)

* And for constant pressure (more convenient to work in chemistry):
![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.30.11.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 17.30.11.png)

* In both cases (constant pressure and volume), heat is a state function. So, we define **Enthalpy**:
![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.09.15.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.09.15.png)

*
* At constant pressure:
![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.10.17.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.10.17.png)

* Enthalpy has the same role at constant pressure that internal energy has at constant volume!

* Comparing enthalpy and internal energy:

**Heat Capacities**

* **Heat Capacity** is a Path Function
*
* Defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree
* It’s different if done at constant V or constant P:
![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.37.10.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.37.10.png)

* Comparing Heat Capacities of an ideal gas:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.43.46.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.43.46.png)

* The difference in enthalpy at two different temperatures is determined from integration of CP over the temperature range (if there’s no phase transition):

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.48.31.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.48.31.png)

*
* At a phase transition, there is no change in the temperature as you add heat (CP→∞), so one must also add any enthalpy associated with a phase change where needed. For example:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.51.46.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 18.51.46.png)

*
* Example of phase transition: Benzene

**Thermochemistry**

* **Heat of Reaction**: Heat involved in a chemical reaction
* At constant pressure, heat of reaction is given by:

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 19.08.19.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 19.08.19.png)

* Different kinds of reactions according to ΔH signal:

* Entalphy is a state function, which means it is an additive property (Hess Law)

**Standard Enthalpy**

* _ΔrH_ is extensive: its value depends on the number of moles of the reacting species
* To facilitate tabulation, IUPAC created the standard enthalpy of reaction, which is intensive, _ΔrH°_
*
* Implies one mole of a specified reagent and all reactants and products in their standard states at a given temperature

* The standard enthalpy of reaction to form one mole of a substance from its constituent elements in their naturally occurring elemental forms defines the intensive standard molar enthalpy of formation, _ΔfH°_

![Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 21.53.22.png](image/Screen Shot 2015-02-27 at 21.53.22.png)

*  Values of _ΔfH°_ for pure elements in their most stable forms at one bar and the temperature of interest is set to _**zero**_

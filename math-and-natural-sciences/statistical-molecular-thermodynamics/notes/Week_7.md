* Comparing with dS total differential expression, we have:

**Third Law of Thermodynamics**

* Third Law of Thermodynamics:_ Every substance has a finite positive entropy, but at zero Kelvin the entropy may become 0, and it does so in the case of a perfectly crystalline substance_

* Thinking by molecular point-of-view:

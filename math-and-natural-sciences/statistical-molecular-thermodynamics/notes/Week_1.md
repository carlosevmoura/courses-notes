# Week 1

**Introduction**

* The energetics of reactions are important for all chemical processes
* _Entalphy_: a property of a substance
* _Heat Capacity_: energy quantity to raise the temperature of a substance

**Benchmarking Thermoliteracy**

* **Thermodynamics** has long been recognized as one of the most powerful and useful tools in chemistry and physics and all the physical sciences
* First Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1901, to J. H. van’t Hoff by Chemical Equilibrium

**Quantization of Energy**

* **Quantum Mechanics** provides the foundation principles for all molecular processes
* **Molecular Statistical Mechanics** builds upon that foundation, to serve as basis for thermodynamics

**The Hydrogen Chloride Cannon**

* Calculates the energy given by a blue laser that activate this reaction

**Atomic Energy Levels**

* Connecting macroscopic thermodynamics to a molecular understanding requires that we understand how energy is distributed on a microscopic scale
* Energy in atoms could be related to electronic movement and translational nuclear movement
* _Degeneracy_: Different solutions of Schroedinger’s Equation which presents the same energy

**Diatomic Molecular Energy Levels**

* Energy is stored as electronic, translational, rotational and vibrational energies

**Polyatomic Molecular Energy Levels**

* Molecular Degrees of Freedom:
*
* Translation:
*
* Motion of center of mass: 3

* Rotation (orientation about center of mass):
*
* Linear molecule: 2
* Non-linear molecule: 3

* Vibration (frame-free movement of _n_ nuclei):
*
* Linear molecule: 3_n_-5
* Non-linear molecule: 3_n_-6

* Total: 3_n_

*

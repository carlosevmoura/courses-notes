# Week 6 - Lecture 2 - Realizing the Solar Park

**Infinity Solar Cell*** When we start printing the roll and the machine is running, it's connecting every single printed cell in series;
* This way, it's possible to make an infinite array of serial connected cells;
* Infinity Solar Cell should need:
*
* No vacuum;
* No scare elements;
* Scalable;
* R2R components;
* Low temperatures;
* Liquid processing;
* Minimum energy-pay-back time;

* The system called "IOne" uses different layers, printed directly in the barrier in this sequence:
*
* Silver grid;
* PEDOT:PSS;
* ZnO;
* P3HT:PCBM;
* PEDOT:PSS;
* Silver grid;
* UV Lamination with a back barrier;

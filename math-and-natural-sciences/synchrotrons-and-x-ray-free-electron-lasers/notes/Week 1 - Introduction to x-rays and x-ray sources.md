## Users of Synchrotrons And Their Impact on Society

**Synchrotrons** provide **intense sources of electromagnetic radiation** over broad ranges of wavelengths

- Typically spanning values marginally shorter than that of visible light (beginning at 100 nm in the ultraviolet vacuum regime) to hard x-rays with wavelengths that are one to two orders of magnitude shorter than typical chemical bond lengths;

- This kind of light sources has been used by different scientific areas:

**21 Nobel Prizes** given to X-Rays researches since 1901 when Wilhelm Röntgen discovers it.

### Comparison between Bremsstrahlung Radiation and Synchrotron Radiation

**Bremsstrahlung radiation** (German for *braking radiation*) occurs when a charged particle is **decelerated by collision** with another particle or an atom.

- The particle loses part or all of its kinetic energy, which is converted into high-energy gamma-ray photons to satisfy the law of conservation of energy;

**Synchrotron radiation** is caused by the emission of radiation from a charged particle **forced to execute a curved trajectory**

- The acceleration is centripetal and therefore at right-angles to the direction of motion.

In an electron storage ring of a synchrotron, the velocity of the electrons **remains nearly constant**, varying by only a tiny fraction of a percent;

- Conservation of energy demands that the electron energy do **become smaller due to the emission of light**. The RF cavity in a storage ring replenishes this lost energy;

## Basics Concepts of X-Rays

### X-Ray Regimes

**Soft X-rays**: begin after the visible and ultraviolet regime and cover a range of 100 nm down to 0.6 nm.

**Hard X-rays**: wavelengths shorter than 0.3 nm.

- Soft X-rays that in general interact much more strongly with matter than do hard X-rays;

**Tender X-Rays**: the transition between soft and hard x-rays is not abrupt and is anyway somewhat arbitrary, depending strongly on the material being irradiated, the concept of tender x-rays was introduced to bridge these two regimes.

### X-Ray Units
Normally, however, one characterizes x-rays by their photon energy *E* rather than their wavelength ![\lambda](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Clambda). The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:

![E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bhc%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D)

- Where:
    - ![h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{J}.\mathrm{s}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h%20%3D%206.626%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-34%7D%20%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D.%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D) is the Plank's constant;
    - ![c = 2.9979 \times 10^8 \; \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{-1}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c%20%3D%202.9979%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E8%20%5C%3B%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%2F%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D%5E%7B-1%7D) is the speed of light in vacuum;

In the hardest (the most energetic) x-rays used in synchrotron science (wavelengths of picometers), photon energies are of the order of  ![10^{-13} \mathrm{J}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10%5E%7B-13%7D%20%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D). Then, we use **electron-volts** as a unit of energy.

**1 Electron-Volt** (![\mathrm{eV}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathrm%7BeV%7D)) is the energy an electron gains if it is accelerated in a vacuum (no collisions) from a cathode plate to an anode plate which is ![1 \mathrm{V}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1%20%5Cmathrm%7BV%7D) (![1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.6022%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-19%7D%20%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D)) more positive in potential;

Planck-Einstein equation in electron-volts and Angstroms:
![E\[\mathrm{eV}\] = \frac{12398.4}{\lambda} \; \[\unicode{xC5}\]](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E%5B%5Cmathrm%7BeV%7D%5D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B12398.4%7D%7B%5Clambda%7D%20%5C%3B%20%5B%5Cunicode%7BxC5%7D%5D)

The vacuum ultraviolet and soft x-rays produced at synchrotrons begin at 10 to 20 eV and continue up to approximately 2000 eV.

- Hard x-rays begin at 4 keV;
  - They are used in medicine and airports because of their vast penetration depths;
- Tender regime spans the gap between 2-4 keV;

Gray (Gy) is the **unit to describe absorption of x-rays**.

- 1 Gy is equal to one Joule of absorbed radiation energy per kilogram;

### X-Ray Properties

X-rays are considered **"nondestructive" radiation**, because allows seeing the inner structure and composition of an object without the need to open or slice it.

Hard x-rays have wavelengths comparable to or shorter than **typical distances between atoms** (bond lengths). This property of hard x-rays makes them useful in **investigating the atomic structures of materials**.

- The shortest bond length is of the ![\mathrm{H}_2](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathrm%7BH%7D_2) molecule: ![0.74 \; \unicode{xC5}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0.74%20%5C%3B%20%5Cunicode%7BxC5%7D);
  - Bonds between heavy elements can exceed ![3 \; \unicode{xC5}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=3%20%5C%3B%20%5Cunicode%7BxC5%7D) (4 keV);
  - 10 keV x-radiation pass over carbon-carbon single, double, and triple bonds;

Hard x-rays have energies **similar to bonding energies of core electrons in atoms**.

- The hard x-ray regime can access all elements with atomic numbers above ![Z = 20](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z%20%3D%2020) (Calcium);
  - This property can be exploited in hard x-ray spectroscopies and also in crystallography, to solve structures;

The lower photon energy of x-rays means that they interact primarily with light atoms and the **outer (valence) electrons of heavier atoms**. It can be used to investigate:

- Electronic properties of metals, semiconductors, and superconductors;
- The chemical composition of heterogeneous systems;
- Imaging of magnetic domains down to the nanometer scale;

## Synchrotrons and XFELs

**Synchrotron** is a very brilliant source of light or electromagnetic radiation.

| *Schematic of a synchrotron facility.* |

### Synchrotron components:

1) **Source of Electrons** (Electron Gun):

	- A heated metal filament ejecting electrons by thermionic
emission;

2) **LINAC** (evacuated linear accelerator):

	- Electrons are then accelerated over an ultrahigh vacuum conditions (pressures $10^{-9} \; \mathrm{mbar}$);

3) **Booster Ring**:

	- The energy of the electrons is further ramped up until they attain the design energy of the main “storage” ring;

4) **Storage Ring**:

	- Into which they are injected and where they are stored and are used to generate synchrotron radiation;
	- Electrons now have Giga-electronvolts of energy (relativistic speeds, exceedingly close to the speed of light);
	- The path of the electrons is controlled by **bending magnets**;
	- The straight sections between the bending magnets, **the insertion devices**, are used to insert alternating arrays of north-south, south-north magnet dipoles, are the more brilliant sources of synchrotron radiation;

5) **Beamlines**:

	- Tangential position to the BMs and IDs;
	- The place where we can use the synchrotron radiation;

### Desired properties of X-Ray Radiation

- Intense;
- Monochromatic achievable (relative spectral bandwidth);
- Parallel (horizontal and vertical beam divergences);
- Emanate from as small a source point as possible (source size);

**Brilliance** Formula:
![B = \frac{n_{\mathrm{photons}}}{\Delta t \times \epsilon_x \times \epsilon_y \times 0.1\% \mathrm{BW} }](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bn_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bphotons%7D%7D%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cepsilon_x%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cepsilon_y%20%5Ctimes%200.1%5C%25%20%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%7D)

- Where:
    - *B* is brilliance;
    - ![n_{\mathrm{photons}}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bphotons%7D%7D) is the number of photons;
    - ![\epsilon_x](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cepsilon_x) is the emittance in horizontal direction;
    - ![\epsilon_y](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cepsilon_y) is the emittance in vertical direction;
    - 0.1 BW corresponds to 0.1% of the bandwidth of the central wavelength (dimensionless)

![B = \frac{\mathrm{photons}}{\mathrm{second} \times \mathrm{mrad}^2 \times \mathrm{mm}^2 \times 0.1\% \mathrm{BW}}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bphotons%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bsecond%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cmathrm%7Bmrad%7D%5E2%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cmathrm%7Bmm%7D%5E2%20%5Ctimes%200.1%5C%25%20%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%7D)

| *Progress in X-Ray Brilliance, in comparison with the Moore's Law for computes.* |

The latest development in synchrotron technology has focussed on improving the brilliance **not by increasing the photon flux, but rather by reducing the source size and divergence
of the beam**.

- **Diffraction-limited storage rings** (DLSR) promise a further two orders of magnitude increase in brilliance compared to third-generation synchrotrons by using more bending magnets, each magnet forcing the electrons to turn through a smaller angle;


### X-Ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs)

**X-ray free-electron lasers** are new sources of x-radiation, with peak brilliance approximately ten orders of magnitude higher still than modern synchrotrons.

They produce trains of pulses with durations between a range 1-10 fs.

- This is over three orders of magnitude shorter than pulse lengths produced by synchrotrons, and **sufficiently short to follow chemical reactions as they occur in real-time**;

Synchrotrons and XFELs are thus **complementary** to one another.

#### How XFELs works?

| <img src="images/xfel-architecture.png" width="500"> |
|:--:|
| *X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Architecture.* |

1) A short electron bunch is generated by irradiating a metallic target with a femtosecond laser pulse;

2) This is accelerated in a LINAC and then undergoes one or more bunch compressions to make the pulse shorter by a factor of 100;

3) The shortened electron pulse is then accelerated along a long LINAC to several GeV energy;

4) Enters a long array of alternating north-south, south-north magnet dipoles, called "undulator";

	- This long magnet array is required to induce a phenomenon known as **self-amplified spontaneous emission** (SASE);
	- The result of SASE is that, after exiting the long ondulator magnet array, the electron bunch has been altered such that it is now **divided into microbunches**, each having a duration of only a few femtoseconds;
	- These bunches produce the femtosecond x-radiation characteristic of XFELs;

## Some Useful Notes

#### How to obtain the relative bandwidth from the absolute value?

| <img src="images/bandwidth.png" width="500"> |
|:--:|
| *Bandwidth illustration.* |

Absolute BW is given by:

![\mathrm{BW} = f_H - f_L](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%3D%20f_H%20-%20f_L)

To obtain the relative bandwidth $\% BW$ from absolute values of frequencies ![f_0](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_0), ![f_L](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_L) and ![f_H](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_H):

![% \mathrm{BW} = 100 \times \frac{f_H - f_L}{f_0} = 100 \times \frac{\mathrm{BW}}{f_0}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%25%20%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%3D%20100%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7Bf_H%20-%20f_L%7D%7Bf_0%7D%20%3D%20100%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%7D%7Bf_0%7D)

So, for 0.1%, we have:

![0.1 \% \mathrm{BW} = 0.1 \times \frac{f_H - f_L}{f_0}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0.1%20%5C%25%20%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%3D%200.1%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7Bf_H%20-%20f_L%7D%7Bf_0%7D)

Using energies instead of frequencies, the BW is given by:

![\mathrm{BW} = \Delta E](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%3D%20%5CDelta%20E)

![0.1 \% \mathrm{BW} = 0.1 \times \frac{\Delta E}{E_0}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0.1%20%5C%25%20%5Cmathrm%7BBW%7D%20%3D%200.1%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20E%7D%7BE_0%7D)
